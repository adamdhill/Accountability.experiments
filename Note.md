Introduction
-----------------------------------

Tool designed to allow beahvioral and experimental social scientists to improve neutrality in naming of governmental institutions when creating economic games or vignettes. 

Experimental researchers sometimes ask participants to engage with *existing* governmental institutions. For example, an experiment might ask participants to assess the success of a regulation or policy. For example, Healy et al. (2015) find evidence of partisan bias in attributions of blame in the aftermath of government failure. 

A significant body of behavioral research, however, is designed to generate data about not about the specific performance of existing institutions, but, rather, to generate data about institutions that perform some characteristic task. For example, the research might be interested in assessing public attitudes toward regulation of the public financial markets generally. In order to make the vignette or economic game less artificial (McDermott 2002), researchers might decide to give the institutions involved *names*. Simply naming the institution in the game or vignette by an analogous institution might bias participants. Completely disassociating the hypothetical institution from institutions of which participants are aware might lead to confusion, however. Thus, a researcher might want to cue the participant about the *general type* of the agency or department, but not to suggest complete identification with analogous institution.


Mechanics 
-----------------------------------

First, we import the most common agency acronyms. At present, these are taken from government websites. Ideally, the list would be shorter, and would be generated from reliable measures of public salience. Second, we identify the frequency of the characters used in these acronyms. Finally, we use a letter generator to select letters with those probabilities.


Improvements going forward
-----------------------------------

(1) Pull agency acronyms directly from source (e.g., Federal Register), which will make compatible with non-US institutions
